# Unfathomed Rescore

A small mod that swaps music for certain bosses, leaving Unfathomed Force exclusive to one specific fight.  
Tested on NISA PC version of the game.

## Features
* Changed music for three major boss battles in the game's final chapter, including one track from a different Trails game.
* Slight changes to some pre-battle cutscenes for (subjectively) better flow.
* Edited track names for game's BGM info feature, to fix grammar and typos (e.g. my favorite "Bell That Doesn't Supposed to Ring" → "A Bell That Cannot Ring"). Names were taken from the Kiseki Wiki.
* Works with both English and Japanese script.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release of `Unfathomed-Rescore.zip` ([here](https://github.com/TheShufflingFool/Unfathomed-Rescore/releases/latest)).
2. Locate the game's main directory:
   * for Steam version, right-click on `Trails to Azure` and select Manage → Browse local files
   * for GOG version, right-click on `Trails to Azure` and select Manage installation → Show folder
3. Open the downloaded file and extract the `data` folder into the game's main directory (you can just drag and drop or copy and paste).
4. When prompted to merge folders and replace files, accept all changes.
5. To uninstall, verify integrity of game's files (note that this will delete all other mods as well).
   * Optionally, you can navigate to game's main directory → data → bgm and delete the `ed7700.opus` file before starting the verification.

## Mod compatibility
* [More Portraits in Azure](https://github.com/shinkiseki/MorePortraitsInAzure) - compatible

* Evolution BGM Mod - incompatible

## FAQ
* **Will this work on Steam Deck?**  
  Most likely yes. I don't own one so I can't test it myself but, seeing that other mods work on it, I don't see why this one wouldn't.

* **Will this work on the Geofront version?**  
  Most likely no. Again, I don't own it so I can't test it but, as far as I know, NISA and PH3 made some pretty extensive changes.

* **I want to use all 3 mods. What do I do?**  
  Install the mods in the following order: More Portraits → Azure Vitality → Unfathomed Rescore

* **I'm in the middle of my playthrough. Do I have to start a new game to use the mod?**  
  No, it can be installed at any point. Although, naturally, if you're past any battle that this mod touches, you won't be able to experience it with modded music without loading an older save.
  
* **Why did you use track X instead of Y?! It's better!!!11**  
  I made this mod for myself, first and foremost, and released it to sort of celebrate the second anniversary of Azure's western release. The tracks I picked are the ones I associate with these characters (or their organizations).
